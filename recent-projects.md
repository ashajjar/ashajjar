# Recent Projects

Most of my recent work is on private or proprietary codebases and cannot be shared publicly. It includes production-grade backend systems, distributed services, and internal tooling, with a strong focus on system design, performance, and long-term maintainability. While the source code cannot be published, the work reflects industry best practices in architecture, testing, and reliability engineering.
